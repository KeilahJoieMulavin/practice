# This is a practice code

## Steps to successfully commit and run commands in VS Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Check status
3. Make some changes
4. Save the file
5. Check status again
6. Run add command (add . to add everything, add + name of file - for a specific file only)
7. Run commit command + -m + "message here" (+ -m + "message here for extended description" = optional)
8. Check status again (to see if changes are committed to the repository)
9. Run push command (in order to be able to see the changes in the code live in the web)
10. Check the github live in the website to verify if the changes were reflected
11. Make changes, add another file, and repeat the process.
